# Poros: Configurable Proxies for Distant Interactions in VR

## Overview

Repo for public dissemination of source code for the project, Poros. Please read the paper to learn more about what Poros is, how it works and what it is intended for. Here is a link to the paper: <https://static-curis.ku.dk/portal/files/260600438/Poros.pdf>. In addition, you may find the video useful to see the various features in action: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijurCmalZ3o>.

This project was developed with an HTC Vive HMD, with a Leap Motion attached to the HMD to provide hand tracking. Whilst this was developed using the HTC Vive, it may work for other headsets, but this has not been tested. You can read about the Leap Motion mount for HMD's here: <https://www.ultraleap.com/product/vr-developer-mount/>. This project also uses Leap's interaction engine, meaning that it would take some effort to get this project to work with a different hand tracking system, such as the Oculus Quest's.

In this Unity project, there is a main scene that you can use to explore the features Poros in a virtual library environment. For specific instances of each feature listed in the paper, please see "Scenes/Feature Test Scenes".
